1. Download the zip or use git tools to clone
2. Use eclipse to open the archive / project

or

1. Create a new Java Project in eclipse
2. copy the contents of git_repo/src into the new JavaProject/src

then

3. add javafx ...hopefully done already >_< 
4. add jsoup. I simply added the jsoup jar directly to the project file, but should be fine as an external lib in eclipse too

link to jsoup --> https://jsoup.org/packages/jsoup-1.14.3.jar
