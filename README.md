Download the zip or use git tools to clone or se eclipse to open the archive / project
or create a new Java Project in eclipse and copy the contents of git_repo/src into the new JavaProject/src

configure javafx and jsoup (i added jsoup directly to project lib as an external jar, but should work as eclipse lib)
